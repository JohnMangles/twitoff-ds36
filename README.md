# twitoff-ds36

A Python library running the 
twitoff-ds36.herokuapp.com
web app. Takes user inputs of two twitter users, and potential tweet text.
Uses spacy's natural language processing to turn 200 tweets from each user into vectors, then fits a logistic regression model to predict which user is more likely to have tweeted to potential tweet.
